# TicTacToe
A TicTacToe Game made using Flutter and Nodejs

This project is a WIP (Work in progress). Once I am finished, I will update this readme to include ways to install this app on your system.
For right now, you can either install the `app.apk` file in the [release](https://github.com/KaywebDev/TicTacToe/releases/tag/0.1.0-alpha) for Android,
or you can clone this project and use `flutter install` to install the app from the project folder.
